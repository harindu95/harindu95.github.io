Hello everyone!

I decided to build a personal website with Jekyll.
For those of you who doesn't know, Jekyll is a static 
website builder. You can write blog posts in Markdown and 
don't have to worry about databases and CMS.

This is my first time using it. It wasn't hard to figure it and create this site. 
You have to first install jekyll with bundler.

    gem install bundler jekyll
   
Then you can create a website with the following command

    jekyll new web-site-name
   
You can view it locally with

    jekyll serve
    
There are lots of free Jekyll themes on internet, inlucding the one I am using which is called 'kasper'. There are paid themese too if you want them.

The one problem I had was meshing two themes together. I want to add a 'resume' to my website and decided to use a different theme catered for cv. But I couldn't find how to use two themes at once. 

So  I decided to mesh the online-cv theme into kasper. It wasn't hard as it could have been but it wasn't easy either.

Anyway now it's working, so I hope I can keep blogging without losing interest.
