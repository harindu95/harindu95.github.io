Hello again,

I have finished my final exams and I thought I would write about Gallium OS today.

Gallium OS is a ubuntu distro optimized for Chromebook.

I have a Acer R11 Chromebook which I used with Crostini apps.
Crostini allows us to run a linux container inside Chrome OS. And we can also run Android apps on Chrome Os. I noticed significant performance issues when using both of them at once. 

I decided since I don't really use Android apps , to Gallium OS a go. First I had to update my firmware.
Which you can easily do with the script provided [here](https://mrchromebox.tech/)

After that it was easy to install Gallium OS. But my keyboard was not responsive which I found out was a fault of Gallium 2.1. Therefore I had to install Gallium 3.0 alpha.

While it is a alpha, it runs flawlessly on my computer. As I am linux geek then I tweaked my setup to my hearts content.

Hope you guys give Gallium OS a go if you have a chromebook.
